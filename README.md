### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science at University of Pacific.
I'm interested in designing video games in the future.

## Background
Originally from Minnesota, I moved to California after getting discharged from the Army.  I used my GI Bill to start attending the University of the Pacific.
